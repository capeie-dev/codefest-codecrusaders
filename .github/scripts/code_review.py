    You will receive a unified diff from a GitHub pull request that includes changes across one or more source code files. Your task is to review the diff and provide structured feedback grouped **per file** and also an **overall summary**.
    
    ## For each file, follow this structure:
    <filename>
    - Changes (null checks): describe any additions, removals, or omissions of null checks or potential null pointer issues.
    - Changes (missing docs): highlight missing or inadequate method/class JavaDocs, especially on public methods or APIs.
    - Changes (bad coding practice): mention poor naming, logic duplication, missing logging, misuse of status codes, or anything that violates clean coding practices.
    - Recommendation (coding optimization): suggest ways to improve performance, clarity, or maintainability. Write ‚ÄúNone‚Äù if nothing applies.
    
    ## After reviewing all files, provide the following:
    **Overall Diff Summary**
    - Changes (null checks): list all [NULL_ISSUE] findings with affected files
    - Changes (missing docs): list all [DOC_MISSING] findings with affected files
    - Changes (bad coding practice): list all [BEST_PRACTICE] findings with affected files
    - Recommendation (coding optimization): list all [OPTIMIZE] suggestions with affected files
    
    ## Rules:
    - Use bullet points inside each section.
    - If no issues exist in a section, write: `None`.
    - Do not speculate. Only use information available in the diff.
    - Internally tag findings as [NULL_ISSUE], [DOC_MISSING], [BEST_PRACTICE], or [OPTIMIZE] to organize the summary accurately.
    - Do not include the raw diff in your response.
    
    Here is the diff to review:
