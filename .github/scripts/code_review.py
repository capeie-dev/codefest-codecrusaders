    You are provided a unified diff of code changes. Analyze the changes and provide a structured, professional review grouped by file. Focus on clarity and actionable insights.
    
    ### For each file, use this format:
    
    **<FileName>**
    
    **Null Safety Issues**
    - Briefly describe any null-related risks (if none, write “None”)
    
    **Documentation Gaps**
    - List any missing or incomplete JavaDocs (e.g., missing @return)
    
    **Code Quality Observations**
    - Point out inefficient code, duplicated logic, bad naming, logging issues, or other best practice violations
    
    **Suggestions for Improvement**
    - Recommend optimizations or best practices (e.g., caching, clearer naming, simplified response construction)
    
    ### At the end, write a brief summary in this format:

    ### 🧾 Summary of Findings
    
    **Files Reviewed**: List file names  
    **Null Issues**: FileName + 1-line summary  
    **Missing Docs**: FileName + issue summary  
    **Code Quality**: FileName + issue summary  
    **Suggestions**: High-level recommendations to improve the codebase

    Keep it concise, helpful, and easy to read. Avoid repeating the same points in both file sections and the summary unless important.
