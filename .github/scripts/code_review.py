    - Display the file name as a heading.
    - Show the related code diff for that file.
    - Provide concise analysis of any issues found in that file.

    - Highlight issues such as missing or insufficient documentation (e.g. JavaDocs), potential null pointer issues, inefficient or redundant logic, and violations of coding best practices.
    - Provide exactly {num_points} bullet points across all files combined.
    - Use this format for findings:
      - [TAG] Short title: brief description
      - Use tags: [DOC_MISSING], [NULL_ISSUE], [OPTIMIZE], [BEST_PRACTICE]
    
    At the end, include these two summary sections:
    
    Recommendations for Code Optimization:
    - List specific suggestions to improve performance or simplify logic.
    - Write "None" if nothing to suggest.
    
    Recommendations for Best Practices:
    - List suggestions related to documentation, naming, structure, error handling, etc.
