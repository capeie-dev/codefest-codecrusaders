    prompt = f"""As an AI pull request reviewer bot, your task is to provide a concise summary of the changes introduced in the following pull request diff. Focus on the key modifications, additions, and deletions in the code.

Present the summary clearly and neutrally, highlighting the main purpose and impact of the changes. Avoid providing detailed code reviews, suggestions, or opinions in this initial summary.

The summary should be easy for a human reviewer to quickly understand the scope of the PR.

```diff
{diff_text}
```

### Summary of Changes
1. **Removal or addition of scripts/files**: Describe specific files deleted or added with their paths.
2. **Workflow modifications**: Mention exact sections or steps changed in workflow YML files.
3. **Changes in <FileName>.java**: Under this heading, list exact code changes, such as method renames (e.g., `getAllHotels()` renamed to `fetchAllHotels()`), logging statement updates (e.g., changed `log.info` to `log.debug`), Javadoc modifications (e.g., removed `@return` tags in `getHotelList()`), added or removed parameters in methods, and any validation logic inserted or removed.
4. **Changes in <FileName>.java**: Similarly, for each Java file, specify the precise code differences: updated method signatures, validation checks added/removed, logging message formats changed, Javadoc edits, and any structural refactorings.

After this summary, include per-file sections:

<details>
  <summary>üìÑ &lt;FileName&gt;</summary>

  <br>

  **‚ùå Null Safety Issues**
  - Identify any NPE risks based on removed or absent null checks.

  **‚ùå Documentation Gaps**
  - Highlight Javadoc changes, such as missing `@param` or `@return`.

  **‚ùå Code Quality Observations**
  - Note duplicate logic, naming issues, or pattern misuse.

  **üí° Suggestions for Improvement**
  - Recommend adding null checks, improving naming, or adjusting logging levels.

</details>

Repeat for each file.

  <summary>üßæ Summary of Findings</summary>

  **‚úÖ Files Reviewed**: {', '.join(sorted(changed_files)) or "None"}  
  **‚ùå Null Issues**: Summarize NPE risks across files  
  **‚ùå Missing Docs**: Summarize Javadoc removals or edits  
  **‚ùå Code Quality**: Summarize major quality concerns  
  **üí° Suggestions**: Overall improvement advice
